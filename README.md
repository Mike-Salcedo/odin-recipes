# odin-recipes

**This project is a recipe page with three fantastic, delectable, and incredibly easy recipes you can prepare at home.**

Through this initiative, I've developed my skills and knowledge in the following areas:

- HTML list tags.
- linking HTML pages together through a relative relationship between pages.
- Image tags.
- Git Commands.
