    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      A Christmas cookie recipe for soft sugar cutouts that I have used for
      years. I sprinkle the cookies with colored sugar before baking; you can
      also frost them with icing when cool.

    <h2>Christmas Cookies Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Flour:</strong> These classic Christmas cookies start with
        all-purpose flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Baking powder: </strong> Baking powder acts as a leavener, which
        means it makes the cookies rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Salt: </strong> A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but
        it won't make the cookies taste salty.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sugar </strong>
        and <strong>margarine</strong> : White sugar is beaten with margarine.
        You can use butter if you prefer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Eggs:</strong> Two eggs lend moisture and bind the dough
        together.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vanilla:</strong>
        Two teaspoons of vanilla extract is the perfect finishing touch.
      </li>
    </ul>
